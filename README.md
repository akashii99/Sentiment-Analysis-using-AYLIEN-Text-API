# Sentiment-Analysis-using-AYLIEN-Text-API

This project is divided into three tasks.The tasks we’ve selected are:

 1. Building a corpus — using Tweepy to gather sample text data from Twitter’s API.
 2. Analyzing text — analyzing the sentiment of a piece of text with our own SDK.
 3. Visualizing results — how to use Pandas and matplotlib to see the results of your work.
 
 Here we have performed sentiment analysis on 200 tweets about Women's day.
